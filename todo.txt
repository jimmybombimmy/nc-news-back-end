To do: post-revisit
* Follow on from getting articles by topics and put the others into place
* Try to incorporate all of the queries into one optional piece of SQL code (like with your film-fly data call)

To do: Pre-revisit
* refactor my errors so that they can be imported in the model as apposed to being written out explicitly there
* sort out the tests for the example responses and the responses themselves as they aren't exactly accurate
